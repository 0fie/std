# The `std` Cell

... is the only cell in `divnix/std` and provides only very limited functionality.

- It contains the TUI, in `./cli`.
- It contains a `devshellProfile` in `./devshellProfiles`.
- It contains a growing number of second level library functions in `./lib`.
- Packages that are used in std devshells are proxied in `./packages`.

That's it.
