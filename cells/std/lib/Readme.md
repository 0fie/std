# The `std` library

This library may accumulate over time library functions that provide
integrations with other frameworks or are so overwhelmingly & generally
useful that upstreaming them into Standard cannot be withheld.

In general, though, `std` is already opinionated enough in order to grow
this library very conservatively, only.
