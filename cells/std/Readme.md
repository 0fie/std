# The `std` Cell

... is the only cell in `divnix/std` and provides only very limited functionality.

- It containes the TUI, in `./cli`.
- It containes a `devshellProfile` in `./devshellProfiles`.
- It containes a growing number of second level library functions in `./lib`.

That's it.

In that it showcases _some_ functionality of `std` while also not only being
useful, but _actually_ used.
