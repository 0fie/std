# Nixago Presets

These are out-of-the-box configurations of Nixago Pebbles.

You can amend them the same way they, themeselves, amend the base Nixago Pebbles:

```nix
{{#include ./../../../../cells/presets/nixago.nix}}
```

`just` doesn't have a preset: for a task runner, it wouldn't make a lot of sense.

_If you have a good idea how to make these presets more useful, please consider to submit a PR._
